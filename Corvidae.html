      We aim to promote bike safety and accessibility, and to inspire biking as a
      alternative to fossil fueled travel within Portland and have some fun while weâ€™re at it!
      Come join us for a 2nd Sunday ride every month. We meet at the Rose Fountain
      at the center of the Peninsula Park Rose Garden at 2 pm. We roll out at 2:30.
      This will be a social-paced mystery ride. We will make a few stops. Each ride
      is lead by a different CORVIDAE member, and therefore will be unique.  NOT A LOOP.
      We will have Pop-UP rides every so often as well! This is a safe environment for all;
      Please see the CORVIDAE Code of Conduct. Ca-CAWW!
